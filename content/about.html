<p class="news">I'm a PhD student in Computing Science at Simon Fraser University advised by <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/~xingdong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xing-Dong Yang</a>, started September 2023.</p>

<p>I received my master's degree in artificial intelligence from National Chiao Tung University, Taiwan, where I was advised by <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/yctseng" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yu-Chee Tseng</a> and <a href="https://people.cs.nctu.edu.tw/~chencz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jen-Jee Chen</a> under <a href="https://pairlabs.ai/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PAIR Labs</a>.</p>

<p>My research interest lies at the intersection of machine learning and human-computer interaction. I want to build intelligent machines that understand the environment from sensory inputs and create novel interfaces that deliver seamlessly interaction.</p>
